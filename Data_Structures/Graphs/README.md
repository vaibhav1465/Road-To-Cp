Graphs
This repository provides a collection of graph algorithms and data structures implemented in Java. Graphs are fundamental data structures used to model relationships between entities. This library offers a variety of functionalities for working with graphs, including graph creation, traversal, shortest path calculation, and more.

Features
Support for directed and undirected graphs.
Creation and manipulation of graphs, including adding and removing vertices and edges.
Traversal algorithms for exploring graphs, such as depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS).
Algorithms for finding the shortest path between two vertices, using Dijkstra's algorithm.
Algorithms for finding minimum spanning trees, such as Prim's algorithm.
