Graphs
This repository provides a collection of graph algorithms and data structures implemented in Java. Graphs are fundamental data structures used to model relationships between entities. This library offers a variety of functionalities for working with graphs, including graph creation, traversal, shortest path calculation, and more.

A graph can be visualized as a set of points (vertices) connected by lines (edges). The vertices represent the entities, while the edges represent the relationships or connections between them. Graphs can be either directed or undirected, depending on whether the edges have a specific direction or not.

Features
Support for directed and undirected graphs.
Creation and manipulation of graphs, including adding and removing vertices and edges.
Traversal algorithms for exploring graphs, such as depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS).
Algorithms for finding the shortest path between two vertices, using Dijkstra's algorithm.
Algorithms for finding minimum spanning trees, such as Prim's algorithm.

Terminology
Here are some key terms used when discussing graphs:

Vertex (Node): A fundamental unit of a graph. It represents an entity or an object. Vertices are often labeled with unique identifiers or values.

Edge: A connection between two vertices. It represents the relationship or connection between the entities represented by the vertices. Edges can be directed (one-way) or undirected (two-way).
